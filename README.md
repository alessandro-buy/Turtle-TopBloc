# Turtle-TopBloc
README
This is my internal coding assignment in a repostiory with my favorite animal, Turtle as the name. (Technically Turtle-TopBloc). In order to run the code, simply
clone the repostiory and run the TopBlocStudent/src/main/java/TopBloc main method. Everything should run smoothly. I used Maven for building.
